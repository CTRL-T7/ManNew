              The Manufacturers Association of Nigeria (MAN) was established in
              May, 1971 as a company limited by guarantee. The establishment of
              the Association was motivated by the desire to have a focal point

              hand, and the government and general public on the other.
              Hitherto, there was no institutional organ whose central focus was
              to give meaning to the interests, problems and aspirations of the
              manufacturing sector.
